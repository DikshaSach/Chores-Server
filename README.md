# Chores-Server
A sort of "Todo style" application. Allows users to enter items or "chores" to be done for the day posted on sticky notes. Then users can go in and click complete for each item. An empty/fresh board is loaded everyday. Users are also able to delete their posts on the present day or edit them.

## Updates
Currently working on UI and attemping to learn animations/gradient effects and use material ui to its maximum capability to get a feel for how things really work.

## Upcoming updates
Add a feature which allows users to see uncompleted tasks for the month which they can go in and hit complete on when finished. 

## API 
Currently only has one router ````'.../chores/'````
